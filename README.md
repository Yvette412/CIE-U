# CIE-U: University Educational Inclusion Index Questionnaire

## Overview
The *Cuestionario de √çndice de Inclusi√≥n Educativa de Nivel Universitario* (CIE-U) is a psychometric instrument designed to measure levels of educational inclusion in higher education institutions. Based on the Index for Inclusion (Booth & Ainscow, 2015), this tool was adapted for Latin American contexts with the support of UNESCO. The CIE-U evaluates six key dimensions of inclusion in universities, promoting inclusive cultures and equitable learning environments.
