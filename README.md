# CIE-U: University Educational Inclusion Index Questionnaire

## Overview
The **Cuestionario de Índice de Inclusión Educativa de Nivel Universitario (CIE-U)** is a psychometric instrument designed to measure levels of educational inclusion in higher education institutions. Based on the *Index for Inclusion* (Booth & Ainscow, 2015), this tool was adapted for Latin American contexts with the support of UNESCO. The CIE-U evaluates six key dimensions of inclusion in universities, promoting inclusive cultures and equitable learning environments.

## Key Features
- **Objective:** Measure educational inclusion at the university level.
- **Dimensions:** 
  1. Building Community
  2. Establishing Inclusive Values
  3. Developing an Educational Institution for All
  4. Organizing Support for Diversity
  5. Constructing a Curriculum for All
  6. Orchestrating Learning
- **Structure:** 24 Likert-scale items validated through psychometric methods.
- **Population:** University communities, including students, faculty, staff, and administrators.

## Development and Validation
The instrument underwent rigorous validation:
- **Content Validity:** Expert reviews refined items to ensure relevance and clarity.
- **Construct Validity:** Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) assessed the structure.
- **Pilot Studies:** Conducted with diverse university stakeholders to evaluate psychometric properties.
- **Ethics:** Adaptation permissions from UNESCO and informed consent from participants.

## Repository Content
- **Questionnaire:** The CIE-U instrument in Spanish.
- **Documentation:** Technical reports detailing development, validation processes, and results.
- **Data:** Anonymized datasets from pilot studies for replication and further research.
- **Guides:** Instructions for implementing the CIE-U in different university contexts.
